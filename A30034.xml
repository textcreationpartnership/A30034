            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>I</hi> WO<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>LD not be underſtood to write against the People called <hi>Quakers</hi> in general, for I know that many of our Miniſtring Friends, as they have not concerned themſelves at theſe <hi>Monthly, Quarterly, Yearly,</hi> nor <hi>Second-day-Meetings</hi> in making Laws, Orders, Directories, and Preſcriptions to bind the Conſciences of their Brethren to the Obſervation of this, that, or the other Ceremony or Practice in Religion; nor to impoſe doubtful Things upon them, contrary to their Faith and Perſwaſion, as knowing what is not of Faith is Sin; <hi>SO ALSO</hi> in Suffering Times I have obſerved them to be as ready to Suffer and bear their own Burthen, as to exhort others to Conſtancy and Pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and thereby have been good Examples to the Flock, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Neither would I be understood to charge <hi>G.

            </p>
            <div type="section">
               <head>Now ſee what ſuch have told the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and others, to be both <hi>Romiſh</hi> and <hi>Antichriſtian.</hi>

               <p>Secondly, Jo. Cole <hi>ſays The Church of</hi> Rome <hi>doth not admit that every one ſhould walk &amp; act as they are perſwaded in their Conſciences: which is a</hi> Popiſh <hi>Practice.</hi> (See the Whore <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nvailed, <hi>pag. 71, 72.</hi>

               </p>
               <p>Where is now the plain Text of Scripture to avouch this, or a Preſident for it, and the diſtinct Womens-Meetings, unleſs in the <hi>Pope's Nunnery?</hi> Where <hi>R.

Do they not by this Law or Cannon declare plainly, that they impoſe both to do and Practice, which is at once both <hi>Romiſh-like, Papiſt-like,</hi> and <hi>Antichriſtian.</hi> And what we would not have the Church of <hi>England</hi> Men do unto us.

               </p>
               <p>So have the Miniſters of <hi>G.

                     <p>FRiends, I have lately proffered <hi>S.

C.</hi> will referr this Matter of the <hi>5 l.</hi> alſo, by Arbitrators indifferently chozen by us, I will do the like, and be equally bound to ſtand to their Award. Thus deſiring to ſhew my willingneſs to a Complyance to Juſtice and Equity, I rest; deſiring an Anſwer in fourteen days time.</p>

               <p>And the like I proffered <hi>S. C.</hi> by Letter, dated, the <hi>22d.</hi> of the <hi>4th.

               <p>And having thus anſwered the <hi>Objection,</hi> I am willing to let my Reader know, that I do not lay all this blame upon poor <hi>S.

I confeſs, 'tis a strange prepoſterous way of Proceeding to print and publiſh a Controverſy: for, on the <hi>3d.</hi> of the <hi>8th.</hi> Mo. last, he ſent me a Letter, that he had given (I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, to his Brethren, for I could never ſee it) a full and true <hi>Narrative</hi> from the beginning, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And by another Letter on the 26th. of the 10th.

               <hi>GEORGE WHITEHEAD,</hi> I have peruſed thy abuſive Book, called <hi>Judgment Fixed:</hi> wherein I find thee ſo falſe and perfidious, that Humanity and the Law of Charity condemns thy detracting Inſinuations and abominable Defamations; in which at this time I purpoſe not to trace thee particularly, for that is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, ſince my Book, <hi>De Chriſtianâ Libertate,</hi> &amp;c. ſtands, and remains unſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by all thy Attempts; as the ingenious Reader will ſoon obſerve when he compares thy Book with mine: nei<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>her ſhall I altogether paſs thee by, but as thou comeſt in my way, I ſhall obſerve thy ſcurrillous Treatment, which if thou wert ſuch a tender, meek and pretious Spirited man, as thy Brother <hi>Robert Sandiland,</hi> in his Book falſely called, <hi>Righteous Judgment,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>p.</hi> 89. hath Printed and trumpeted thee to be, ſurely thou wouldſt have ſhewed more meekneſs and tenderneſs than therein can be found. But his Trumpet ſounds ſo much of <hi>G.

               <hi>That if I will call in my Book, and as publickly own my Condemnation as I have given Offence, thou thou and others will ſtop your further Proceedings against me,</hi> &amp;c. To which Letters I gave thee Anſwer, which I think expedient to cite, that both at the beginning of this Relation, and at the end, it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear how loath I was to proceed.

                  <p>This day I received thine, dated the <hi>26th.</hi> of <hi>December, 1682.</hi> — And if thou art not willing to ſtand to the Agreement made at our Quarter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-Meeting in <hi>Hadenham,</hi> the firſt day of the <hi>10th.</hi> Month <hi>1680,</hi> and then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in their <hi>Quarterly Book,</hi> that all Controverſy, betwixt thee, <hi>G.

As for the calling in my Book, I am willing, on condition the Orders upon Record in our <hi>Quarterly Book,</hi> which ſay, that for time to come no Marriages are either to be ſuffered or permitted except the Parties publiſh their Intentions twice before the <hi>Mens</hi> and <hi>Womens-Meetings,</hi> they being, as thou knoweſt, diſtinct and apart each from others; and the Record againſt <hi>J.

                  <p>But whereas thou threatens me with a great talk of a further Publication of a Narrative, of which I have heard much, it doth not trouble me, neither do I believe it would have been thus long detained from publiſhing in Charity or good Will to me hadſt thou not been conſcious to thy ſelf that the Publication thereof would have been a further means to have unmasked thee and ſuch as thou art. This is my ſenſe and as ſpeedy an Anſwer as I can well give, who am thy well-wiſhing, though much abuſed Friend,</p>

               <p>IN the 22d.

F</hi>'s Over-ruling Party look upon themſelves not obliged to tell their Names and Habitations unleſs demanded by a Magiſtrate; and by virtue of this their Opinion and Practice, I ſay, great have been the Sufferings of the Auditors; for beſides theſe <hi>Fines</hi> which come thus upon them through our Miniſters concealing their Names and Habitations, they commonly bear the Fines for their own Offences againſt the ſaid Statute, and the Offences for the <hi>Meeting-Houſes,</hi> and the <hi>Fines</hi> for their poor Neighbours; inſomuch as that in the Loſs of 13550 and odd pounds, which I have collected out of five Printed Books preſented to King and Parliament; of which the Miniſters that were Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers never loſt 50 <hi>l.</hi> and if I ſhould add what hath been deſtrained beſides what is in thoſe five Books, which I preſume is a far greater Summe; ſtill the Miniſters of this Self-ſaving and other-oppreſſing Principles, ſuffer lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle in conſideration of what the Hearers ſuffer; inſomuch that ſome of the Hearers have been ſo impoveriſhed, through their <hi>Fines</hi> impoſed for their Miniſters through their hiding their Names, under pretence that it is not demanded by a Magiſtrate, as that they have been neceſſitated to borrow mony to relieve themſelves, which to this day they have not been able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pay; while <hi>S. Cater,</hi> though a Rich Man, hath been ſupplyed with ten pounds at a time from <hi>London</hi> (and if he denies it, I offer to prove it) for a <hi>Fine</hi> which he ſuffered for Preaching at <hi>Phakenham</hi> in <hi>Norfolk,</hi> and diſtrained at <hi>Littleport,</hi> but through the moderation of the Officers 'tis be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved that he did not looſe 5 <hi>l.</hi> as I have often ſignified to him, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But ſo it fell out, that in <hi>November</hi> 1675 he happened to have a Meeting at <hi>Laken-heath</hi> in <hi>Suffolk,</hi> where the High <hi>Constable</hi> and ſeveral others came and demanded the Name of the Preacher; but he was ſo buſie that he had no leiſure to tell them his Name and Habitation; ſo one of them asked a Woman Friend, whoſe Anſwer was, that <hi>his Name was written in the Lambs Book of Life, where he could not read:</hi> ('tis to be noted, he was one of our Miniſters that obtained that belief in this well-meaning Woman) ſo then they asked <hi>N.

<pb n="6" facs="tcp:44050:11"/> Uncle <hi>James Bugg</hi> in the Office of <hi>High-Constableſhip,</hi> &amp;c.) came to me, I being at the further end of the Room, and asked me his Name. And I not being willing to equivocate as others did, and well knowing that if I anſwered him to his Queſtion, it could not put him into a Suffering Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty (for it muſt be by the Oath of two Witneſſes or Confeſſion of the Party) I ſaid, <hi>Samuel Cater:</hi> and after ſome time having taken ſeveral Friends Names, went away; and a while after the <hi>Constables</hi> of <hi>Mildenhall,</hi> where I dwelt, came and deſtrained me for my own <hi>Fine</hi> 10 <hi>s.</hi> and 15 <hi>l.</hi> becauſe the Name and Habitation of the Preacher was not known to the <hi>Magistrate,</hi> neither could it, for his Habitation was never mentioned, and all that the <hi>Infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mers</hi> could ſwear, was, that they heard <hi>F.

Syday</hi> his Name was <hi>Samuel Cater,</hi> but to their own knowledge they could not tell, he being a Stranger; and as this <hi>Oath</hi> would have been illegal, ſo would the <hi>Justice</hi> reject it, if any ſuch Evidence was offered; but for my plain anſwer to this <hi>High-Constable</hi> (which I think we ſtand obliged, as Men (except we be doing that we are aſhamed of) to give to the Chief Magiſtrate at that time) how have I been traduced, abuſed, and ſtigmatized, and at every turn, and upon every ſlight occaſion (and by ſuch heady and fooliſh People amongſt us, through the influence of <hi>S.

               <p>Theſe Goods lying in the <hi>Conſtables</hi> Cuſtody untill the beginning of <hi>March</hi> following, and then ſold. My Brother <hi>J.

So after ſome time, <hi>Juſtice Shelly</hi> ſaid to me, <hi>Francis,</hi> you do not wiſely for your ſelves, to proſecute your <hi>Appeals;</hi> and many Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons he ſhewed me, in kindneſs, I believe; and when I found his Opinion fuit with my <hi>Council,</hi> I told him that I had been at great Charges in the proſecution of the three <hi>Appeals,</hi> and how the Clark of the Peace exact<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

Then I told him, that if he pleaſed, I would move it to <hi>G. Bernadiſtan</hi> (his ſpecial Friend) to that he readily agreed; ſo <hi>Samuel, Gyles,</hi> &amp; <hi>I</hi> met and debated the Matter; but <hi>Gyles</hi> concluded, that there was no reaſon for <hi>Samu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el</hi> to give any thing in compenſation. So then I told them that I ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pound it to the <hi>Yearly-Meeting</hi> by way of Queſtion. And I would hear their Reſolve, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Concluding, that they who exhort others to Suffering (and <hi>to be bold,</hi> and <hi>to give up all,</hi> and <hi>not to heed the Fleece</hi>) would be ſo equal and juſt, ſo full of Nobility, as to conclude it but a reaſonable thing for them to ſtand in a like ſuffering Capacity with the Hearers, whom they thus exhort to <hi>Conſtancy</hi> and <hi>Courage;</hi> but the <hi>Yearly-Meeting</hi> had made a <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive Decree,</hi> that we muſt neither FORSAKE, DECLINE, nor REMOVE our MEETINGS, like WORLDLY, FEARFUL, and POLI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TICK PROFESSORS, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So on the 18th. of the 3d. Month 1676, I went to the <hi>Yearly Meeting</hi> in <hi>Devonſhire-Houſe,</hi> where were aſſembled <hi>G. White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:44050:13"/> S. Criſp, W. Penn,</hi> and nigh a hundred more of our Miniſters. And I told them I had ſomething to ſpeak, ſo they admitted me Audience; ſo I ſaid, <hi>That by the late</hi> Act, <hi>if the Miniſter declare not his Name and Habitation, where he is a Stranger, the Penalty for his Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing did not center or terminate in him; but by the Law may</hi> [by the <hi>Juſtice] be transferred to the Hearers, and thereupon I had a Queſtion to move to them, which was, Whether the Miniſters ought not to declare their Names and Habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, where they are Strangers, on the apparent Sight of</hi> Informers <hi>coming in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a Meeting, taking Friends Names in Writing, or otherwiſe, in order to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vict the Meeting, that ſo we may all,</hi> Viz. <hi>both Miniſter and Hearer, ſtand in a like ſuffering Capacity?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To which <hi>Steph.

Pinder</hi> for a Preſident: <hi>Hold, hold</hi> (ſaid <hi>G. Whitehead) I have ſomething to ſay:</hi> but before he could well explain him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, <hi>W. Penn</hi> being quick-ſighted, ſaw there was a depth in the Queſtion, and did not know what might be the product of it (as I conceived by the Reſult) to have ſuch a Matter ſo publickly debated; wherein their <hi>Interest</hi> was ſo much concerned, he immediately adjourned the <hi>Meeting</hi> to <hi>Horſly-Down,</hi> to be at the 7th. hour the next morning, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So the next day I with ſeveral others went thither, where <hi>S.

Bugg, <hi>what haſt thou to ſay?</hi> I anſwered, <hi>Nothing: No?</hi> replyed <hi>Steven, what, didſt not thee move a Queſtion yeſterday?</hi> Yes, ſaid I, and I had my Anſwer; which was on the Affirmative, and thou quoted <hi>R.

                  </gap>ion in his Anſwer. But what is a lawful Demand? ſaid I: Then <hi>G. W.</hi> Replied, by a Magiſtrate: and ſaid I, Is not a <hi>Chief Constable</hi> a Magiſtrate? <hi>Yes</hi> (ſaid <hi>W. Penn) if he hath his Staff.</hi> So then I deſired to ſhew my Reaſons why I propounded the ſaid Queſtion: <hi>S. Criſp</hi> replyed, <q rend="margSglQuotes">That they would hear no Reaſons, for it was a ſuſpitious Queſtion.</q> To which I replyed, <hi>Nay,</hi> if you will hear no Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, I have done. And <hi>G. W.</hi> adding, ſaid, <hi>We will lay no ſuch Yoak on the Diſciples Necks.</hi> [He might have ſaid, <hi>We will not take off ſuch a Yoak, that lies heavy on the Diſciples Necks for fear it ſhould lye on our own</hi>] And ſo bid <hi>Ellis Hooks</hi> Record it: which I preſume was done, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>So then I ſaw on what Bottom they placed the neceſſi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>y of telling their Name and Habitation, which was if a Magiſtrate turned <hi>Informer,</hi> and came and asked it; which in the Countrey, where perhaps a <hi>Juſtice</hi> doth not live within 8 or 10 Miles, and <hi>Conſtables</hi> ſeldom wear a <hi>Staff.</hi> And alſo conſidering the Cannon or Decree that the Miniſters made the year before; by which none were to be owned as Members of the <hi>Church of Christ,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept

But yet as to the <hi>Objection,</hi> I do ſay, that I have ground to think, that they hate to put their People upon any Suffering, but they will ſtand with them in the ſame Capacity relating to that Suffering which comes by means of their Exhortation, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> One Inſtance thereof I may al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo give the Reader; for I am willing to carry along with me Demonſtration of reaſon, for whatever I aſſert: and altho I do ſo (as in my laſt Book I did) yet I expect no other Treatment from the Hand of <hi>G.

                  </hi> yea, <hi>Devil Incarnate:</hi> with abundance of other Names like unto them; for they will be again ſadly angry at the Diſcovery of theſe their hidden Myſteries. But let the <hi>Beaſt</hi> rage, and the <hi>Dragon</hi> caſt out his Floods with what Vehemency he is able; yet <hi>Babylon muſt fall; and Wo to the Crown of Pride in that day,</hi> &amp;c. The Inſtance I offer to vindicate the <hi>Profeſſors</hi> by, is this that followeth: See the 4th. Part of the <hi>Conformiſt's Plea for the Nonconformiſts,</hi> pag. 58, 59. Where 'tis ſaid, that <hi>Thomas Jolly</hi> was fined 20 <hi>l.</hi> for Preaching; and when the Officers could not come at his Goods; the Juſtice granted two Warrants to take Diſtreſs of two of his Hearers: and when this was done, the ſaid <hi>T. Jolly</hi> redeemed the Hearers Goods, and paid his Fine of 20 <hi>l.</hi> himſelf (this is the Practice of ſuch as <hi>G. W.</hi> &amp;c. term <hi>Cowardly, Fearful,</hi> and <hi>Worldly,</hi>) but <hi>S. C.</hi> was ſo far from redeeming my Goods, and pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his Fine himſelf, as <hi>T. J.</hi> did, that he would pay nothing, like his Brother <hi>John Moon</hi> who (as I am credibly informed) altho he among others of <hi>George Fox</hi>'s Preachers, pretend to high Dignities, yet when ſome Friends were fined for him, he adviſed them to appeal; but being askt if he intended to ſtand by them if they ſuffered for him, he an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, <hi>No, not a Groat,</hi> &amp;c. Now let the Tree declare by the Fruit it bears, whether it be good or bad (and the Reader judge whether <hi>T. Jolly</hi> or <hi>S. Cater</hi> and <hi>J. Moon</hi> acted moſt Chriſtian-like) and not by the Leaves; for the fair Floriſhes of deceitful Leaves have we been too much deceived; and theſe covetous Practices ſhew in what the Miniſters of <hi>G.

               <p>Still the ſame reaſon that there would be, if the <hi>Informers</hi> did ask: which is, that he may thereby ſet himſelf in a like ſuffering Capacity with his Brethren, ſeeing his <hi>Fine</hi> centers not in him, as I have ſaid. Indeed if the <hi>Law</hi> by which we ſuffer, did ſay, <q rend="margSglQuotes">That if when the <hi>Informers</hi> have asked the Miniſter his Name and Habitation, then if the Miniſter refuſe to tell it him, it ſhall and may be lawful for the <hi>Juſtice</hi> to impoſe the <hi>Fine</hi> of 20 <hi>l.</hi> on the Hearers preſent,</q> then I grant there would be good reaſon for this <hi>Objection;</hi> for then there would be no Forfeit until the <hi>Informers</hi> had performed their part of asking, and the Miniſter his part of denyal. But behold the <hi>Law</hi> requires no ſuch thing; wherefore the <hi>Informers</hi> may chooſe whether they will ask, or not ask; moreover it is greatly againſt the Intereſt of the <hi>Informers</hi> to ask this Queſtion; for if the <hi>Informers</hi> ask, and the Miniſter tell it him, then Proviſion is made in the <hi>Act,</hi> that a <hi>Warrant</hi> may be ſent after him, <hi>Viz.</hi> the Miniſter; and he being at a great diſtance, and by reaſon of the <hi>Officers</hi> Moderation, and other Accidents, there may be Delays; inſomuch that he may looſe great part of his Reward; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as if the Miniſter doth not tell his Name and Habitation, then If there be but one able man in the <hi>Meeting,</hi> the <hi>Fine</hi> is obtainable of him: and beſides, if the Miniſter tells his Name and Habitation, if he be poor, there can be but 10 <hi>l.</hi> laid on any one Perſon, by reaſon of a <hi>Clauſe</hi> in the <hi>Act,</hi> which limits the Caſe of Poverty to 10 <hi>l.</hi> So that if there be but ONELY

                     <p>YOu at this time are the men to whom I dedicate theſe Lines, by way of <hi>Introduction</hi> to this following <hi>Narrative,</hi> hoping there dwells in you as Noble a Principle as did once in the <hi>Bereans,</hi> which may move you to a Search whether theſe things be ſo or no; which is impoſſible you ſhould do, except you will admit me a hearing, and therein reſemble good old <hi>Moſes,</hi> who (in all Caſes Controverſial between Brethren (as well as <hi>Solomon,</hi> and divers other good <hi>Judges</hi> recorded in Scripture) SAID, <hi>Hear to the full, ſearch diligently, Judge impartially.</hi> And inaſmuch as I find by many of your Writings, and declared Principles, that you are like-minded with them. I write theſe few Lines to you; yea, and the rather, becauſe I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve you came forth at firſt in true Self-Denyal, and never ſought your ſelves: otherwiſe to what end ſhall I write to you? for it is a true Saying, <hi>The World loves its own.</hi> And if I ſhould write to ſuch as came into the Profeſſion of the Truth, poſſeſt with little, and are now grown Great and High, and can Lord it over their Brethren; as that too many ſuch there are amongſt us, What acceptance ſhould my words find? ſurely none but retorts
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:44050:19"/> of Severity. Wherefore let ſuch as are like them chooſe them, who may expect help by them: for ſo it was in former Times: and altho I never ſpoke a word to two of you, directly nor indirectly; yet this I ſay, that if <hi>S. C.</hi> will chooſe three others, I will chooſe you three, and to your Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination I will abide; and why this ſhould be denyed me, I know not; except to gratifie ſome eminently guilty; otherwiſe, methinks, a Hearing ſhould not be denyed me, it being ſuch a reaſonable thing, &amp;c.</p>

               <p>And much to this purpoſe I wrote to them, and ſent to <hi>W. P.</hi> but as yet could not obtain a Hearing, <hi>S. C.</hi> being a Preacher, and had the Ruling-Party on his Side, and ſo had the Opportunity from Countrey to Countrey to ſpred his own Fame, and my Reproach: that at length I was reſolved to appeal from our Chief Lords, to the <hi>Epiſcopalians</hi> for a Hearing; and then I ſoon got a Hearing, as afterwards I ſhall ſignifie; but firſt I would give a ſhort Deſcription of the Behaviour of our <hi>Monthly</hi> and <hi>Quarterly Meetings,</hi> who endeavoured to put me by writing (for I was <hi>Clark</hi> to the <hi>Meeting</hi> for many years, tho never for <hi>Salary,</hi> as in ſome Places they have) but they could not put me by, until I laid it down of my own accord, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                           <hi>Friends, this is hard meaſure, that</hi> F. B. <hi>ſhould be put by from that Service wherein he hath been ſo long imployed, for meer matter of Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy betwixt you two, and you both have put it out of your own hands.</hi>
                        </p>
                     </sp>

                        <speaker>S. C.</speaker>
                        <p>
                           <hi>It is the deſire of good Friends</hi> (he might have ſaid, <hi>his good Friends) that he ſhould not write,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                        <p>
                           <hi>So it will grieve good Friends if he doth not write: but what good Friends will it grieve if he doth write? we in this Meeting are the men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned,; and for my part, I know no reaſon why he ſhould not write; indeed I heard that ſome did oppoſe him the laſt Meeting here: but when I heard of it, I was troubled.

B. <hi>be put by writing,</hi> S C. <hi>ſhould be put by from Preaching until it be decided who is in the wrong: ſo let them both be ſilenced together.</hi>

                           <hi>Yes, if the one muſt be diſplaced, then both, except you can both let all paſs until your time of Tryal comes.</hi>

                  <hi>Obſervation.</hi> So then <hi>S. C.</hi> was ſilent, and it was time for him, for I will tell him, he would have had the worſt of it; for Preaching hath been a thriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Trade to him, who by vertue thereof hath received ſeveral Summs of Money, 10 <hi>l.</hi> at one time, and 3 <hi>l.</hi> at another time, and 40 <hi>s.</hi> at another time. This, when ever we come to the Teſt, I offer to prove, if he will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny it: and yet theſe Augmentations are ſo private, that 'tis very ſeldome that any knowledge can be gotten of their Stipends: and then <hi>G. W.</hi> will deny it, as Stared, <hi>Viz.</hi> If we have not the very words they uſe at the Gift thereof. But for my part, I never deſired, nor took a Penny for all my Journies, Writing, <hi>Births, Buryals, Certificates</hi> for Marriage, and Recording
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:44050:20"/> them, drawing out a brief Hiſtory of all the moſt remarkable Sufferings in the <hi>Iſle</hi> of <hi>Ely.</hi> So that if I had been ſilenced, it would have been great ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage to me; for my place was not ſuch a profitable Place as <hi>Samuel</hi> made his Preaching to be; ſo that it was time for him to hold his peace, and to let me alone, ſince 'twas come to that, that if I was put by from ſerving in my laborious Work of Riding every Month 14 or 18 miles to write <hi>gratis,</hi> that then he the ſaid <hi>Samuel</hi> muſt be put by his fat and lovely Place of Preaching, which had raiſed him from ſuch a low degree, as ſcarce able to pay his Debts when he went to Days-Works, with his <hi>Ax, Saw, Chiſſel</hi> and <hi>Mallit;</hi> but now is worth many hundreds of pounds: let ever a poor man in <hi>Little-Port</hi> (the Place of his Abode) that had nothing by Inheritance, ſhew the like Advance if they can, yea, their <hi>Pariſh-Preacher</hi> himſelf, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and yet poor <hi>S. C.</hi> he could not, like a <hi>Prieſt,</hi> have power to chooſe a <hi>Clark;</hi> which by the <hi>Cannons</hi> and <hi>Constitutions</hi> of the <hi>Church of England</hi> is their Right. <hi>(to wit, the Prieſts)</hi> And truly <hi>R. S.</hi> was very bold to propoſe to Silence <hi>S. C.</hi> from his <hi>Preaching-Trade,</hi> ſince that alſo is the <hi>Biſhops</hi> Buſineſs: but however <hi>R. S.</hi> knew that <hi>S. C.</hi> was a <hi>Non-conformiſt</hi> to the Superiour <hi>Courts,</hi> and ſo did not fear him; for which I then did, and ſtill do commend <hi>R. S.</hi> &amp;c. See <hi>Cannons</hi> and <hi>Conſtitutions,</hi> 92. 122. And the Reader may obſerve how <hi>S. C.</hi> acted the part of a proud inſulting <hi>Prieſt,</hi> and <hi>R. S.</hi> the part of a hearty <hi>Biſhop,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>We had many Combats at many more <hi>Meetings,</hi> which for brevity ſake I omit; yet I ſhall relate ſome Paſſages of one <hi>Meeting</hi> more at <hi>Hadenham,</hi> where I did ſhew them, that it was <hi>E. Burrough</hi>'s Opinion, that they were accountable; and that <hi>W. P.</hi> reckoned it the <hi>Parliaments Duty</hi> to call the <hi>Lord Mayor</hi> to account; upon which <hi>J. A.</hi> did ſay, <hi>That if any body had ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered through him in that Caſe, and ſhould make Complaint, he would pay to the Doublet of his back.</hi> And ſeveral others condemned <hi>S. C</hi>'s Stiffneſs and Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution. <hi>R. S.</hi> and <hi>J. A.</hi> would ſay often, that if they were as I, <hi>they would have born it;</hi> and if they had been as <hi>S. C. they would have paid it.</hi> Yet <hi>S. C.</hi> would not meet me half way; for that I often proffered, for Peace-ſake; but after I had begun, I was determined, having Right on my ſide, not to be Prieſt-Ridden by <hi>S. C.</hi> &amp;c.</p>

               <head>Obſervations.</head>
               <p>By this time, through the Perſwaſion of <hi>R. S. E. L.</hi> and <hi>J. A.</hi> I got a little leave to begin my Matter, but they would not hear me out, nor yet give me a Copy of their <hi>Award;</hi> and yet complained of me becauſe I would not ſtand to it, though I did not know how they had bottomed their <hi>Award,</hi> nor what I ſhould ſtand to. But that, and the burning my <hi>Papers</hi> without looking into them, did ſhew that they were minded to over-rule me, and fore-judge me. So hear what they gave me leave to ſay.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>F. B.</hi> Five things I have to offer, (and ſhall, if you will hear me, main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain my Aſſertions.)</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>That the Miniſters who are Strangers ought to ſet themſelves in a like ſuffering Capacity with the Hearers,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>That S.</hi> C. <hi>did not ſo ſet himſelf.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. <hi>That my Anſwer to</hi> T. S<hi>'s Queſtion was nothing in order to</hi> S. C's <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, neither by Law could be.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>That your acquitting him (if you have ſo done, which until you let me ſee your</hi> Award, <hi>I have no cauſe to believe, nor ſtand to it.) is erronious Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and ought to be reverſed, and the rather becauſe I had no hand in your Choice, but you choſe your ſelves, and alſo refuſe to give me a Copy of your</hi> Award, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. <hi>And thereupon I do demand the reverſing your ſaid erronious Judgment, and you ought to do it upon Conviction of your Errour, unleſs with the</hi> Papiſts <hi>you conceive you cannot err;</hi> or to this effect. So then I began to pull out my Books and Papers, to prove the ſaid five <hi>Aſſertions.</hi> But <hi>P. W. S. F. J. P.</hi> and the reſt of my ſeven Judges looked ſternly upon me, and with one Voice cryed out, <hi>We will have no more of it.</hi> And ſo hindred me from proceeding in what I had further to offer to the Meeting. And theſe were the Judges to whom I ſent the Paper of <hi>Verſes</hi> after, called, <hi>A Preſcript</hi> and <hi>Poſtſcript,</hi> which I have already herein related, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
               </q>
               <p>Thus have I related the moſt pertinent Paſſages relating to the <hi>Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy</hi> betwixt <hi>S. C.</hi> and my ſelf, that I can remember. Thus far, by the help of ſome Letters that I diſperſed among Friends; which ſince the <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy</hi> was like to revive, I have again obtained, for I burnt all I had by me, when <hi>S. C.</hi> burnt his in <hi>Ely</hi> Priſon purſuant to the Agreement that was afterwards made; which had they kept truce, and been faithful to their Covenant, had never more been thus mentioned by me; but ſince they have Printed and Publiſhed the ſame, I am conſtrained to vindicate my ſelf, both as a Man and Chriſtian, which they have defamed, what in them lyes, giving the Reader to know, that I had hard Work with them, I went up Hill, and againſt the Stream. But was this my portion alone? ſurely no; ſearch antient Stories, and the compleat Hiſtory of <hi>Independen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,</hi> the 1ſt. and 2d. part of <hi>Englands New Claims,</hi> and the <hi>Antient and Fundamental Liberties of the People of</hi> England, by <hi>J. Lilburn.</hi> And it will
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:44050:22"/> appear that <hi>Lilburn, Prinn, Overton, Walker,</hi> the Lord <hi>Capel,</hi> and divers others have traced the ſame Path; yet ſo blind is <hi>Force</hi> and <hi>Perſecution,</hi> that I think it neceſſary to draw a Figure for the more perfect Diſcovery of our New Spiritual Lords <hi>Judgment-Seat.</hi>

                  <p>Now before I go any further, I may ſhew the Opinion of two Learned Men in defence of my Opinion, of appealing to the <hi>Epiſcopalians</hi> for Juſtice, when not attainable amongſt our ſelves. The 1ſt. is <hi>R. R.</hi> in a Letter to <hi>T. C.</hi> where he thteatens him, <q rend="margSglQuotes">That if he cannot prove his Charge againſt <hi>R. T.</hi> &amp;c. that he had wherewith to make ſatisfaction for the Defamation, which it may be they will require of thee; ſo that thou mayſt ſeem to conſult thy own Safety. —The Church (ſaith <hi>R. R.</hi>) will require no ſuch Satisfaction from thee, but they cannot reſtrain men in their Civil Concerns, from ſeeking Juſtice in a legal way, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>By which it is apparent that this <hi>R. R. G. W</hi>'s Learned Friend, and the <hi>Second-days Meetings</hi> Clark, his Opinion is, 1. That <hi>T. C.</hi> had need to conſult his Intereſt, unleſs he could prove his Charge of Defamation;
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:44050:23"/> altho no Defamation; but what <hi>T. C.</hi> aſſerted, is generally known by the <hi>Second-days Meeting.</hi> 2. That though the Church will ſeek no ſuch ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, yet ſhe cannot reſtrain men in their Civil Concerns. So that in their Civil Concerns, and in the defence of their Reputation, they may take a Legal Courſe againſt Defamations, and other Injuries, acted by injurious Perſons. And truly, altho I differ from this <hi>R. R.</hi> in ſeveral things about <hi>Womens-Meetings,</hi> and their Juriſdictions, and other things relating to <hi>Church-Government,</hi> yet in this he is of my Opinion; for after I had ſued for a Hearing by Perſons indifferently elected, and uſed all Goſpel Order among our ſelves to obtain the ſame, and all proved ineffectual, then, and not while then, did I offer to appeal from our ſelves to the Legal <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment-Seat</hi> for Satisfaction, not only for Defamation and many Slanders caſt upon me, both as a Man and <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> by <hi>S. C.</hi> which he had caſt upon me ſeveral times; but alſo in a Caſe of Property about <hi>Meum</hi> and <hi>Tuum:</hi> this was then my Opinion, and it remains ſo ſtill; <hi>S. C.</hi> being as little related to me in Church Society, as <hi>T. C.</hi> can be to <hi>R. R.</hi> only the Reader may obſerve upon what ſmall occaſion this <hi>R. R.</hi> threatens a Legal Courſe to be taken, <hi>Viz.</hi> for ſignifying what manner of Perſons they own, in their Society, being conformable, as <hi>M.</hi> and <hi>S. B. T. M. J. S. W. W. S. N. H. F. R. T. S. E. W. G. J. P.</hi> who were ſufficiently known to them to be both ſcandalous to <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> and a Reproach to <hi>Religion.</hi> Nay, if need be, many more may be named, which while ſubject to <hi>G. F</hi>'s new Laws are owned among them, but honeſt men, if <hi>Nonconformiſts,</hi> are traduced and abuſed; <hi>&amp;c.</hi> The ſecond Author is <hi>E. Hickeringall,</hi> another Learned Man, which though in all things he may not be of my mind, yet in this point I will quote him for my Author for his Reaſons ſake. Hear him what he ſays,</p>

All this ſhews not the truth of thy Suggeſtion, but the contrary, as I have a witneſs in the Conſciences of my bittereſt Enemies, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                           <pb n="40" facs="tcp:44050:28"/> for many years in our Meeting, I was nigh a fourth part, and often more, by reaſon many Friends here were then very poor: Neither have I ſpared any pains to prevent ſuffering to come upon Friends; although, perhaps, I have been deſtrained my ſelf; yet my care hath been for them, inſomuch as all the Friends in our Town, beſides my ſelf, have not ſuffered the loſs of <hi>Ten pounds</hi> over and beſides that which I have either lent them, and never had it again, or given them, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And to ſuch Friends in the Miniſtry, as I have been ſenſible have ſtood in need, I have not only given them Money, but Clothed them with the beſt my Shop afforded.</p>
                        <p>And when we in this Town found it convenient to build a Meeting-Houſe, we ſet to it heartily, which coſt us about 75 or 80 <hi>l.</hi> of which I gave 20 <hi>l.</hi> at the building thereof, beſides ſomething it hath coſt me thereupon ſince, not only in Repairs, but being once fined as a Cottage, I defended it from Damage; which was not without Coſt to me; which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing collected and put into the Numeration-Table, will ſhew.

                  <p>This Letter I ſent him, with much more that was in the former part, which for brevity ſake I paſs by, and a little added in the latter part, which I have put into <hi>Parentheſis</hi> for diſtinction, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To which I never had An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer; which ſince, it is there great buſineſs to render me a man ſo bad, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten terming me <hi>Informer, Iudas, a Lover of Money, Falſe, Treacherous, Fraudulent;</hi> and the like, I am the willinger to recite the ſame, in hopes that when it meets with a man endued with Charity, Reaſon and Moderation, he may ſay, <hi>What, is this the man you ſtigmatiſe and traduce in Print, to the ruine of his Reputation among all that believe as the Church</hi> [the Second-days Meeting] <hi>believes? Come, bring forth your Evidences againſt him, and prove your Matter of Charge, for I will not give credit to your Imagination,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">The Memory of <hi>John Story</hi> Revived.</note> (called Sence) <hi>and if you have any real ground for theſe your ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous Detractions and Pernitious Defamations, why did not you bring your Action againſt him at common Law? If you ſay</hi> (as that they muſt, if they will ſay true) <hi>you have no Evidence, why then did you not exhibit a Bill in</hi> Chancery <hi>againſt him, and there crave Relief,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>for, to publiſh your Imaginations and deviſed Stratagems againſt a Man at this rate, in a Caſe that never was yet tryed before the legal Judges; it is a ſhame to your Profeſſion, and it makes you odious to all that hear it: for ſhould every man take your Practice for his Example, the</hi> Printers <hi>would have the beſt Trade. Nay, every Village had need have a Preſs going; ſo that it looks like a piece of meer Revenge, becauſe by his Book publiſhed,</hi> De Chriſtiana Libertate, <hi>he hath manifeſted the Naked Truth of your Errours and Innovations.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus by reaſon I cannot come at a ſight of the <hi>Narrative,</hi> which they told me, was ready for the Preſs four or five Months ſince; I am conſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to carry on the Matter the more large by Letters and Circumſtances formerly tranſacted, that ſo the difference and the nature of it may be the more explained to the unbyaſſed Reader: but as to the true Sons of the
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:44050:29"/> 
                     <hi>Second-days Meeting,</hi> I expect not their Examination; for by an <hi>Epiſtle</hi> or <hi>Caution</hi> put forth by <hi>C. Taylor,</hi> and approved by them, their People are cautioned to the contrary, <hi>Viz. Not to read ſuch Books as are wrote by</hi> W. R. <hi>my ſelf, and others,</hi> &amp;c. Which is not a <hi>Proteſtant Tenate,</hi> I am ſure, nor a doing as they would be dealt by, and they who obey ſuch Doctrine, muſt at the ſame time deny the uſe of their own Sence, Sight, Reaſon, and Underſtanding, and ſo come into the <hi>Papiſts</hi> exact Path of <hi>Implicite Faith,</hi> which is, tho a Man ſee his Horſe is white, yet, if the Church ſay, it is black, he muſt deny the truth, for the Church cannot err, ſhe is gifted with an Infallible Spirit, and ſay (as they ſay in their Book Entituled, <hi>Judas and the Jews,</hi> p. 58. WE NEED NONE TO GIVE US DISCERNING OR JUDGMENT, CHRIST HATH FURNISHT US ALREADY, AND DOTH ON ALL OCCASIONS.) So that what need have we of Proof, or of ſuch Evidence to prove Matter of <hi>Fact?</hi> Let the poor <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants</hi> uſe thoſe beggerly Rudiments at their Judgment Seat, at their Aſſizes and Seſſions, who are ſo cautious, ſo mean ſpirited, and unbeliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that they cannot ſay, Chriſt hath furniſht them with Diſcerning and Judgment UPON ALL OCCASIONS: no, how ſhould they? for they are the World, but <hi>We</hi> are THE, yea, THE CHURCH, and there is none beſides us (except our holy Siſter) and therefore ſince we cannot ſend this Heretick to the <hi>Lollards Tower,</hi> we will write a Book againſt him; and tho the naughty <hi>Proteſtants</hi> will not let us burn him, yet we will murther his Reputation, for what we write and approve on, our People they'l be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve; and if he, or any for him, write any thing in his Vindication, we will command or caution our Sons not to to look into their <hi>Venemous, Dangerous,</hi> and <hi>pernitious Books;</hi> and that they may be throughly deterred from any ſuch Examination (for Examination <hi>We,</hi> nor our Elder Siſter could never abide) we will tell our Sons that <hi>F. B. W. R.</hi> and <hi>T. C.</hi> &amp;c. are <hi>Iudaſes, Informers, Beaſts, Dogs, Wolves, Enemies of all Righteouſneſs, Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of the Devil,</hi> yea, <hi>Devils Incarnate;</hi> and they ought to believe as <hi>We, G. W.</hi> &amp;c. and the Church believes, WE NEED NONE TO GIVE US DISCERNING OR JUDGMENT, CHRIST HATH FURNISH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ED US ALREADY, AND DOTH ON ALL OCCASIONS. And <hi>G.W.</hi> Aſſirms, <hi>That the True Church</hi> (i. e. Themſelves) <hi>is in the true Faith that is in God; and we muſt either be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve thus as the True Church</hi> (i. e. they) <hi>believes, or elſe it were but both Folly and Hypocriſy to profeſs our ſelves Members thereof.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus ſays <hi>G. W.</hi> [I hope the Reader need not be told who he accounts the True Church] and upon theſe two Poſitions, 1. <hi>Chriſt having already,
<pb facs="tcp:44050:29"/> and doth at all times furniſh <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>s both with Diſcerning and Judgment.</hi> We up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that foot, may judge and call them <hi>Wolves, Dogs,</hi> yea, <hi>Devils Incarnate,</hi> or what we pleaſe, and who ſhall controul us? We are ſure we have both Diſcerning and Judgment given us at all times, and upon all Occaſions; Chriſt may now ſit ſtill, Judgment being given to us, we are reſolved to make uſe of it; Chriſt called <hi>Judas</hi> a Devil, and why ſhould not we call <hi>F. B. W. R.</hi> and <hi>T. C <hi>Devils,</hi>
                     </hi> and others, who ſhall interrupt us? Now we are got into the Judgment Seat; and if our Sons will not believe as we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, for we believe that Chriſt hath and doth furniſh us with Diſcerning and Judgment at all Times and on all Occaſions; and to be ſure we are the True Church, or elſe he would never gift us with theſe Ornaments and Jewels. Therefore we have given it out, and do averr, that for any to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs themſelves to be of us, <hi>Viz.</hi> of the True Church, and will not believe as we believe, 'tis both folly and Hypocriſy to profeſs your ſelves of our Society; ſo that if <hi>F. B.</hi> ſhould call for Evidence at our hands, and expect to have us ſtoop to thoſe low and beggarly Traditions that the ſilly <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants</hi> uſe, <hi>Viz. Witneſſes, Juries, Judges,</hi> that will go according to the Evidence, he is greatly miſtaken; For Chriſt, that is Lord of Lords, and King of Kings, he hath given us both diſcerning and Judgment; nay, he furniſhes us therewith on all Occaſions, and we cannot err, having this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible Spirit, and therefore it is more ſafe for our Sons to have an eye to the Brethren, and to believe as we believe, than to adhere to the uncertain Judgment of the Fallable <hi>Proteſtants;</hi> for ſometimes, notwithſtanding their Evidences, their Juries, their Learned Judges, their great Lawbooks, their Clarks to preſerve Records, their Counſellors to open their Caſes, yet for all that, they are (ſome ſay) ſometimes miſtaken in their Judgment; and as for us, Chriſt who is infallible, hath furniſht, and doth furniſh us, not only with DISCERNING, but with JUDGMENT too: not now and then by fits and girds, BUT ON ALL OCCASIONS: So that the Premiſes rightly conſidered, none of you need to concern your ſelves to read what <hi>F. B.</hi> &amp;c. may write in their Vindication, nor calling for Evidence, for that ſignifies little; we have an inward ſence, and from that we judge, and not only judge but report what we there from conjecture, where-ever we go, and that for the Reaſons aforeſaid, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Oh <hi>G. W.</hi> and the reſt of your Ruling and Over-Ruling Elders, who have cauſed the People to erre! Whether will you go? Is not this the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural conſequence that your erronious and pernitious Doctrine and Practice of late lead to? Have we not found it by too woful Experience (and for ſeveral years endeavoured to warn you of the ſame) as in my Book, Enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuled, <hi>De Chr. Libert.</hi> and <hi>W. R</hi>'s <hi>Chr. Qua.</hi> &amp;c. in 5 Parts, and his 7th. and 8th. Part: and <hi>T. C</hi>'s 1ſt. 2d. 3d. 4th. and 5th. Part of <hi>Babels,</hi> &amp;c. Wherein we ſhew what means we have uſed, and what Patience we have
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:44050:30"/> exerciſed towards you, &amp; how many Warnings you have had from time to time: alſo view the Book lately Printed (by many antient Brethren who have kept their Integrity, and not endeavoured Lordſhip and Dominion over others Faith and Conſciences) the MEMORY OF <hi>JOHN STORY</hi> RE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VIVED, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And there ſee how tenderly you have been dealt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al; nothing would prevail, but like a Queen you would Sit, Reign and Tyranniſe over the Conſciences of your Brethren; inſmuch as that I may now ſay to you, as you ſay in your Book called, <hi>Truth's Corrector of Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors,</hi> p. 14. <q rend="margSglQuotes">And know aſſuredly, that if you come to be dealt withal as you have dealt with others, then ſhall thoſe things which you have done to the Innocent become your Burthen — And as you have ſought to make others ridiculous, even ſo ſhall you become contemptible in the eyes of thoſe which you by your Flatteries have fawned upon, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </q> I could ſay more, but the time is not yet come, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I ſay, <hi>George,</hi> Whether wilt thou and <hi>G. F</hi>'s Party climb? Why are you ſo vehemently bitter? What is the cauſe of your rage, that you have the Impudence to call us all theſe bitter Names, <hi>Viz. <hi>Informers, Apoſtates, Iu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daſes, Dogs, Beaſts, Wolves, Children of the Devil, Betraying Iudaſes, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils Incarnate;</hi>
                     </hi> and other vile terms, ſays <hi>G. W.</hi> that tender, meek, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious man, in <hi>R. S</hi>'s eſteem; for ſo he hath Trumpeted him to be, in order to ſound his Fame abroad: and the reaſon that this <hi>G. W.</hi> renders why he calls us thus, is, becauſe Chriſt called <hi>Judas</hi> a Devil. Come <hi>George,</hi> anſwer me plainly, is that all the reaſon thou canſt render for calling me and others, that oppoſe your Innovations theſe Hidious Names? What, becauſe that Chriſt Jeſus, to whom all Power in Heaven and Earth is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, called <hi>Judas</hi> a Devil, who betrayed the Lord of Life and Glory: doth it therefore follow, that <hi>G. W.</hi> may call <hi>F. B. W. R.</hi> and <hi>T. C. <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils Incarnate,</hi>
                     </hi> who profeſs Chriſt Jeſus to be their Lord and Maſter, and deſire to ſerve him according to the beſt of their Apprehenſions; and this in Chariry thou ought to believe, ſince we profeſs ſo in words, and have given Teſtimony thereof both by doing and ſuffering: but ſuppoſe thou beeſt never ſo uncharitable, and conclude us not ſo good Chriſtians as thou could deſire we were; what, hath Chriſt ſurrendred his Judgment-Seat to <hi>G. W.</hi> and given him the Keys, and made him <hi>Vicegerent</hi> on Earth? What, is this Pretious, Tender <hi>G. W.</hi> and meek <hi>G. W.</hi> Surely the <hi>Scotch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man</hi> is miſtaken herein, and his Silver Trumpet gives an uncertain Sound: for when did <hi>F. B. W. R.</hi> and <hi>T. C.</hi> &amp;c. ſpeak a word againſt Chriſt Jeſus, or his Death and Sufferings and Glorious Reſurrection, or any of his Divine Attributes? When did we ever undervalue his Doctrine, his Sermons or Miracles, or ſlight his Holy Commands and Precepts which he gave forth; Oh! thou preſumptuous man; not much ſhort of the <hi>M — nians.</hi> Surely the Lord will reckon with thee and thy Brethren for theſe your ungodly words and Actions, and to him I leave you (who
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:44050:30"/> hath ſaid, <hi>Vengeance is mine, and I will repay it</hi>) not deſiring to render railing for railing, nor Judging for Judging; no, I dare not, I will leave thy State and Condition between God and thy Soul to God only; yet I have leave to diſcover thy Fruits to others, which are manifeſt to me; that others may be aware of the ſower <hi>Grapes</hi> which grow on your Vines, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Well, perhaps thou mayſt ſay, that altho we have not ſpoken againſt Chriſt, yet we have ſpoken againſt your <hi>Orders, Ceremonies, Traditions and Innova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> and your compelling to a Conformity to them. Very well, if that be all, why then didſt thou not lift up thy voice a little higher, and ſtretch the compaſs of thy words a little larger, and fetch in the Prophets that op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the revolting <hi>Iſraelites;</hi> and the Primitive <hi>Chriſtians</hi> that would not ſubmit it to the <hi>Jewiſh Yoak,</hi> and all the worthy <hi>Proteſtants</hi> and holy <hi>Martyrs</hi> that oppoſed the <hi>Whore of Babylon</hi> [your ELDER SISTER] and condemn them all as <hi>Iudaſes, Informers, Wolves, Dogs, Enemies of all Righteouſneſs, Children of the Devil,</hi> yea, <hi>Devils Incarnate.</hi> I ſay, how comes it to paſs that your Preſumption did not lead you ſo high, ſince the Liberty we ſtand for, we offer to juſtifie by their Doctrine and Example, and our oppoſing your Traditional Inventions, and <hi>Babiloniſh</hi> Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remonies and <hi>Romiſh Innovations</hi> you would impoſe upon the People, which we have, do, and I hope, ever ſhall oppoſe; we offer to vindicate our Practice herein by their Example, when ever you will come to the Teſt, and are willing that by the evidence of the Scriptures of Truth (which are the declared and fundamental Laws of Heaven) and the Witneſs of God in all Conſciences, our Cauſe ſhall ſtand or fall, and that thereby the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy may be decided, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Reader may think this too long a digreſſion: but truly the State of things conſidered, and how I and others have been traduced, I hope he will bear with me, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> What account <hi>G. S.</hi> may give in <hi>S. C</hi>'s Narrative more than I have ſpoken to, I know not; but this I affirm (as in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God) that all the ground that I gave him to expect return of the whole, was, <hi>If I end it with thee</hi> (ſaid I to <hi>G. S.) the whole ſhall be tendred, and when done, I ſhould make it appear, that my end was not only for Money.</hi> I ſay, this is all the ground that I gave him; and to fulfil my word, I gave him the ſaid Propoſal quoted by <hi>G. W.</hi> in his <hi>Judgment Fixed,</hi> p. 210. <hi>Viz. That if</hi> S. C. <hi>would Sign it, I would return the Whole,</hi> &amp;c. And let but the Reader rightly conſider <hi>G. S</hi>'s two Paſſages in his Letter, why he gave ſuch account; which was, <hi>leaſt he ſhould looſe the ſaid</hi> 15 <hi>l.</hi> By which his Innocency was betrayed: yea, if his Innocency was not betrayed, and that by <hi>S. C</hi>'s Wife that ſent him: And as <hi>R. S.</hi> and our Friends at the <hi>Quarterly-Meeting</hi> made it appear; why ſhould he now complain under the guilt of it, and ſay, he ſhall never die in peace unleſs he return it? as he confeſſed to a very good Friend of mine this preſent April, 1683. Thus
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:44050:31"/> was the poor mans Innocency betrayed; 1ſt. in acting the beſt he could for them, and when he had ſo done, unleſs he would give ſuch a report as pleaſed them, he was like to bear all the 15 <hi>l.</hi> who having given a falſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, is now perplexed and cannot keep the Money, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> as our Month<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Meeting at <hi>Chatteriſe</hi> recorded it; and when it was recorded, <hi>S. C.</hi> was troubled that the Record did not ſignifie who it was that betrayed his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocency. So the next <hi>Monthly-Meeting</hi> at <hi>Sutton,</hi> and <hi>Quarterly Meeting</hi> at <hi>Hadenham, R. S.</hi> who worded the ſaid Record, and divers other Friends, gave their Judgment in plain words, that <hi>S. C</hi>'s Wife betrayed his Innocency; and this I can prove by <hi>J. E. E. L. R. S. W. B. J. M. L. E. E. N.</hi> and divers other Friends. And indeed it was really ſo; for after ſhe had ſent him, and he had acted what he could for them, unleſs he would give a report that pleaſed them, he had like to have loſt all the 15 <hi>l.</hi> hear his own words as they lye, <hi>Verbatim</hi> in his Letter he ſent me, <hi>Viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <q>I am neceſſitated now to give ſuch a report, leſt the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties concerned ſhould think I was too much byaſſed in joyning with thee, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </q>
                  <p>The next thing I come to take notice of, is <hi>S. C</hi>'s Lawyer, which <hi>G. W.</hi> ſays (becauſe in my Letter to him, I called him a <hi>Lying Lawyer</hi>) is a foul Defamation on his Perſon and Imployment: but doth <hi>G. W.</hi> reckon it ſuch a foul Defamation to call a man a Lyar in a private Letter, when for ought <hi>G. W.</hi> knew I could prove it; and doth he not perceive his own foul Defamation both on my Perſon and Imployment, not only written in a private Letter, but expoſed me in Print to be a man of a <hi>Selfiſh Craft,</hi> an <hi>Over-reaching Man,</hi> a <hi>Fraudulent Man,</hi> a <hi>Lyar,</hi> yea, <hi>Devil Incarnate,</hi> &amp;c. What is this, if it be not foul, baſe and ſcandalous, and a great abuſe both to my Perſon and Imployment: and that which aggravates <hi>G. W.</hi> that meek man's guilt, is, he never knew me to be ſuch a man, he never dealt with me for any thing, neither was he at any Conference that <hi>Samuel</hi> and I have had about this of <hi>G. S.</hi> nor no Evidence to prove it, but <hi>G. S</hi>'s own word, who was <hi>ingaged to give ſuch a Report,</hi> without he would looſe the Money. But perhaps he may ſay, he hath heard <hi>G. S.</hi> ſay ſo, and they ſpeak all one thing, cannot do otherwiſe. And <hi>G. S.</hi> being furniſht (as they ſay they are) both with <hi>Diſcerning and Judgment upon all Occaſions,</hi> he thereupon might ſafely write, print, and expoſe me both <hi>Fraudulent, Over-reaching,</hi> and what not, that might help their holy Caſe, for they act for <hi>Holy Church,</hi> &amp;c. Well, but I have this Letter of <hi>T. R.</hi> by me ſtill (which as able a Lawyer as himſelf gave me) neither am I yet afraid to call him, Lying Lawyer; for I will prove him a Lyar, and one who hath born falſe witneſs, tho he did not ſwear to it: and upon our own Principles of Suffering, as in the Caſe of <hi>Perjury,</hi> on Condition they broke their word, or are found Lyars in caſe of Evidence, to the
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:44050:31"/> damage of others, I ſay, he ought to loſe his Ears, having out done, or run parallel with ſuch as are called <hi>Knights of the Poſt.</hi> And I am ready to think, if this Lawyer by his lying, falſe-witneſs bearing, or any other holy cheat, could have carried this Cauſe for <hi>S. C.</hi> and ſo conſequently for the whole Tribe of Self-preſerving and others-oppreſſing Preachers, or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Praters; he ſhould have had no doubt a good Reward, or Place, as that Lyar <hi>R. R.</hi> hath, by the <hi>Second-days Meetings</hi> Order, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For altho <hi>G. F.</hi> gave advice to <hi>Oliver</hi> and the <hi>Parliament</hi> formerly, <hi>to do things freely,</hi> &amp;c. yet <hi>E. H.</hi> who was late Recorder to the <hi>Second-days Meeting,</hi> had 50 <hi>l. per annum</hi> for his Sallary and Service to the ſame, as I am credibly informed; though it may be I do not ſtate it as to words rightly, but they will not deny it; beſides other good Gifts for writing Certificates. Nay, <hi>G. F.</hi> and he wrote a Primmer to teach Children, much of it Scripture, the <hi>Second Edition</hi> thereof contains but, I think, about 4 or 6 Sheets; and for this <hi>E. H.</hi> took 30 <hi>l.</hi> for the Manuſcript. Theſe are the Free-doers; yea, ſays <hi>G. F.</hi> in his ſeveral Papers given forth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout 1658 and 1659, <hi>Friends, you are to do the Nations Buſineſs freely, and that is the way to get into the Hearts of People,</hi> &amp;c. A notable Stratagem to get into the hearts of People: but then ſurely if the Rule of Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries have any truth, then the way to take and give 50 <hi>l. per annum</hi> for Wages, to a Clark, or the like Summ, and to demand 12 <hi>d.</hi> for a Certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate writing, as <hi>W. R.</hi> in his 7th. <hi>Part</hi> of <hi>Chriſtian-Quaker, Diſting.</hi> &amp;c. more largely manifeſts; and to take 30 <hi>l.</hi> for writing a Manuſcript for inſtructing of Children, and all this by the ſame Clark, <hi>Viz. E. H.</hi> which a Prieſt would have done as much for twenty ſhillings, is not a doing the Nations Buſineſs freely, and conſequently will lead you out of the Hearts of People as faſt as ever you crept into their hearts, by pretending to do all freely. Oh Deceit and Hippocriſy! But <hi>G. F.</hi> his name muſt thus be ſet to the Primmer, <hi>Viz.</hi> G. yea, ſingle <hi>G.</hi> to <hi>E. H.</hi> and yet they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the ſame in <hi>J. P.</hi> Thus is <hi>G. F.</hi> his ſingularity and their Partiality clearly manifeſted. But to return to make ſome little obfervation upon this hot headed Lawyer <hi>T.

                        <p>Surely, <hi>Thomas,</hi> thou thinks thou haſt hit the Matter, and in the Caſe of <hi>Ryots</hi> perhaps thou haſt ſpoken Law, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But yet I muſt need tell thee, it would be very diſ-ingenious (as well as a ſin againſt the Law) for any two or three men to give out a Perſwaſive Letter or Epiſtle to have a Company of poor ſilly Countrymen meet them at ſuch a Neighbours Cloſe, to cut down his Pales, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And when they are in the midſt of their work, the <hi>Conſtable</hi> and other Officers being within their view, coming in order to ſecure them, then for theſe Men who by their Epiſtle thus exhorted them to come up to this Aſſembly, and to be bold and valliant, and not fearful and Cowardly, like a few underly Profeſſors; I ſay, for theſe to take their heels and run away, and leave theſe poor men to ſuffer both for themſelves, and alſo for the Exhorters and Incouragers to this Meeting, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> is very diſingenious, and ſo unmanly, as that the very Highway-men oft times will ſcorn ſuch ſneakiing doings, but will rather fight for their Company to the hazard of their Lives, than to leave them thus in danger. And ſo I ſhould like it better in thoſe <hi>RYOTTRS,</hi> to ſtand their ground, and ſay (being taken by the <hi>Conſtables</hi> and <hi>Informers</hi>) Neighbours, as for theſe poor men we muſt confeſs, we wrote to them in the year 1675, from our <hi>Yearly Meeting</hi> at <hi>London,</hi> and ſigned it by our truſty and well-beloved <hi>G. W.</hi> and divers others, whereby we incouraged them, and bad them not to be like the Worldly, Fearful and Politick Profeſſors, who dare ſcarce venture into ſuch an Affray or <hi>Ryot</hi> as this is, and in a great meaſure 'tis through our means by appointing Time and Place (ſee a Letter to me, the 25th. of the 11th. Mo. 1675. ſent by <hi>J. H.</hi> already incerted for a Preſident) and exhorting them to come and fear no danger, are theſe poor ſilly men inſnared; Pray deal kindly by them, and at moſt let them bear but their own Burthens, as for our ſelves, the Authors of this Ryot (to ſpeak in <hi>T. R</hi>'s ſence) we will bear our own Penalty, and do not deſire it ſhould be laid upon theſe Innocents. I ſay, if the Ryoters ſhould do otherwiſe, I ſhould blame them. But let the Reader know that it is the firſt time that our harmleſs Meetings were ever compared to <hi>Ryots</hi> by our ſelves; but I impute this to the Lawyers wit only in defence of our Rulers Governing, and Elders Plea, who ſay they are not obliged to tell their Names and Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitation, unleſs by a Magiſtrate demanded, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                  <p>But let the Reader note, that as <hi>G. S.</hi> hath been falſe to me, ſo he was not true to the ſaid Meeting, tho he then aſſented to Friends in the ſaid final concluſion; for when <hi>S. C.</hi> and I at <hi>Ely</hi> Priſon in <hi>S. C</hi>'s Chamber, purſuant to the ſaid Agreement, and in concurrence therewith burnt our Papers, <hi>G. S.</hi> never ſo much as met us there; nor did I ſee him burn a Paper; which when I aftewrards conſidered it, I thought there might be a Snake in the graſs; and then altho I burnt every Paper I had in my Cuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, yet when I came where I had ſent and diſperſt Manuſcripts amongſt my Friends, I got what I could of them again, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Well, but however things reſted very quiet for nigh two years, and very ſtill we were, until I put forth my Book, <hi>De Chriſtianâ Libertate,</hi> in the year 82. And I being then in <hi>London, N. L.</hi> told me there was a diſcourſe raiſed about a <hi>Fine,</hi> and my taking 15 <hi>l.</hi> which, as repreſented, did not look well; or to that effect; and asked me if I was free to appear in it: to whom I replyed, yea, I am willing to appear, but that matter is ended, and that upon Record too, in our <hi>Quarterly Book;</hi> but I am willing to defend my ſelf, if they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin: where wouldſt thou have me to come, and when? he ſaid, to morrow about the 9th. hour in the Forenoon to <hi>R. M.</hi> So the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing I went, and with me <hi>L.</hi> and <hi>J. E.</hi> and after a little time there was <hi>T.B. S.H. S.W. E.M. J.B: J.H.</hi> and others, ſo <hi>N. L.</hi> opened the matter, and told us that <hi>R. M.</hi> was his Author for what he ſaid, which was about my taking 15 <hi>l.</hi> of <hi>G. S.</hi> &amp;c. in a fraudilent way and manner, the words I cannot now well remember. So <hi>R.M.</hi> told me that ſo he heard, and if I could clear my ſelf, I might. So I asked <hi>R. M.</hi> over and over time after time, who was his Author, but could not get it out of him, do what I could, as if he had vowed Secrecy; ſo then I told him, that whoever it was, they had broke Covenant, and acted contrary to the Agreement made at our <hi>Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly Meeting,</hi> where were 6 or 7 Friends in the Miniſtry, and about 30 or 40 ſubſtantial men in our Country, where both our Allegations came under Conſideration, were fully heard, and at laſt reſolved into a final end and agreement, purſuant, and in concurrance therewith, I my ſelf, and <hi>S. C.</hi> burned our Writings and Papers, yet ſince thou haſt raiſed it, or at leaſt, ſet it on foot, again I may ſay ſomething in the defenſive part, altho there is little need, for thoſe Friends cannot but conclude, that if it was ended, there were reaſons and grounds to believe that thoſe who had the hearing
<pb n="52" facs="tcp:44050:34"/> of it, and aſſented to the ſaid Agreement, were ſatisfied therewith, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So I run through the heads of ſeveral Paſſages, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Whereupon <hi>E. M.</hi> in their preſence did affirm, that he would make it appear, that if a Miniſter refuſed to tell his Name and Habitation, and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuffered for him by means thereof, if then the ſaid Miniſter ſhould not repay the ſaid Sufferer, it was as bad as if a man ſhould borrow 20 <hi>l.</hi> on a Bond, and refuſe to pay it again, this he offered to make good againſt any man in <hi>London,</hi> and which was to the great ſatisfaction of the Auditors, ſo we parted.</p>
                  <p>And when I came home, here was the ſame News, a Friend that came from <hi>Ely</hi> Priſon, namely, <hi>T. B.</hi> who firſt ſpake about my Book, and then fell upon the Fine, and ſaid, I had no right to it. So then I clearly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, that they had a purpoſe to quarrel with me, and to break the Bond of their Agreement, and ſnap the Cord of their <hi>Quarterly Book</hi> Record, as if no Faith was to be kept with Hereticks, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So then I wrote to <hi>S. C.</hi> this Letter following, to prevent all occaſion of a further Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy, if poſſible.</p>

And to ſuch as refuſe to perform their part in either of theſe two Propoſitions, ought from thence forth to be reput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed blameworthy, and noted as ſuch.</p>

                  <p>I ſay, ſign this Paper, or one like it, and I will return the 15 <hi>l.</hi> for the reaſon aforeſaid; and if this be not a Condiſcention ſufficient enough to pleaſe thee, let me know what thou wouldſt have me to do, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and much more to the ſame effect, which being already in ſubſtance treated on, I am loath to be too repititions.</p>
                  <p>So away I ſent it to him, and when he percived from whence it came, he ſent it to me again, and never opened it, as conſcious to himſelf of guilt, I ſuppoſe, or elſe he would no doubt have read it, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So then that my proffer of giving him the advantage of a ſecond hearing (upon his not being ſatisfied with the <hi>Quarterly Meetings</hi> agreement) might be thorow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="55" facs="tcp:44050:35"/> known to his Friends, I ſent the ſame recited Letter to <hi>G. W.</hi> &amp;c. the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond-days Meeting</hi> (which if there be a Church upon earth, I dare pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, he believes that is) that they might take it into conſideration, and endeavour to prevent further Controverſy. But inſtead thereof <hi>G. W.</hi> ſends me a Copy of what he has Printed; and withal told me, that except I would retract, and call in my Book <hi>De Chr. Lib.</hi> I ſhould not trouble him any more, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And ſoon after I received another large Letter from <hi>S. C.</hi> wherein he makes ſad work about my ſaid Propoſition, calling it unſpiritual, and new Orders and Cannons, and much to that purpoſe; which I ſhall omit at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, as ſuperfluous; for I rather chooſe to manifeſt their erronious Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions and oppreſſive Practiſes, than to anſwer every idle Story I meet with in his Letters, of his Priſon Imployment.</p>
                  <p>In which ſaid large Letter of his I find three or four reaſons, ſuch as they be, why he cannot ſubſcribe the ſaid Propoſition, and leaſt they ſhould come out in his notable <hi>Narrative</hi> ſo long boaſted of, as ſome profound Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, I may write ſomething in anſwer to them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>S. C</hi>'s 1ſt. Reaſon. <hi>It is not my Judgment that ALL Friends in the Miniſtry are bound, without being asked, to tell the Informers their Name and Habitation, being not thereunto required by the Lord, whoſe Mind they THEN have, being Miniſtring in the Power of Chriſt Jeſus, whoſe Word they are to declare faithfully, and not their own, nor</hi> Francis Bugg's.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi> To ſpeak nothing of thy boaſting, as having the <hi>MIND</hi> of God, and miniſtring in the POWER of Chriſt, that not being at this time ſo immediately under my Conſideration. I anſwer, that my Propoſition, which thou ſcornfully calls a Cannon, or new Order, doth not limit any of you, for provided you be but ſo juſt as to re-imburſe ſuch as ſuffer for you,<note place="margin">As at large in my Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtulation.</note> you may conceal your Names as long as you pleaſe. But ſince you at your <hi>London</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation, the 27th. of the 3d. Month, 1675, made a Law or Cannon, that <hi>we muſt neither Forſake, Decline, nor Remove our Meetings.</hi> This we do ſay, that one of them, <hi>Viz.</hi> either tell your Name and Habitation, or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>imburſe the Sufferer, as you ought to do, or elſe we will account you blame worthy, notwithſtanding your boaſting to have Gods Mind, and you miniſter in Chriſts Power. Come, come, we have been fed too long with ſuch chaffy Pretentions, and I know you had rather pay your Money, or not preach at all, than to be accounted blame-worthy; for that would ſpoil the faſhion of your infallible Pretentions, and never-erring Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy.</p>
                  <pb n="56" facs="tcp:44050:36"/>
                  <p>
                     <hi>S. C</hi>'s 2d. Reaſon. <hi>It is my Judgment that all Friends in the Miniſtry in the Name and Power of the Lord, are to be left to do in that, as in their Faith and Freedom they ſhall ſee meet, as they will anſwer it to God, and are not to be limited by</hi> F. B. <hi>nor any other, what to ſay, or what Anſwer to make, when Informers or Perſecutors come into a Meeting where they are Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtring.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>F. B.</hi> Who is about to limit you? you may keep your Names and Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitations as obſcure as you pleaſe, provided you be willing to offer your Sacrifice at your own coſt; for until then I will not take your word, that God is the Author of your Freedom and Liberty: what, you that have the confidence to ſay, <hi>That God moved you to make a Law, That we Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers muſt conſtantly meet, and not Forſake, Decline, nor Remove our Meetings, like Worldly, Fearful, and Politick Profeſſors.</hi> And when you come to Preach, tell us you muſt have your freedom, whether to tell, or not to tell your Name and Habitation. You may as well ſay, <hi>you will have your Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom whether to ſuffer, or not.</hi> Nay, take all the Freedom you can deſire, if your Freedom be not a Cloak or Vizard, under which your oppreſſing and tyranniſing Lordly Spirit Lodges. So take your choice, either tell your Name and Habitation, or re-imburſe him that ſuffers for you: if not, we will ſtill reckon you blame-worthy, whether thou ſubſcribe or not: we have too long let you alone, and this, I hope will be for your Good.</p>
                  <p>S. <hi>C</hi>'s 3d. Reaſon. <hi>I do believe that this new invented Order of</hi> F. B. <hi>tends to the exerciſing Rule and Lordſhip over the Faith and Conſciences of our Brethren: and therefore I cannot ſet my hand to it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>F. B</hi>'s <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Doth it ſo? well, if it did, ſtill <hi>Samuel,</hi> the Hearers have as much right to make a Law for our Miniſters, as our Miniſters have to make a Law for their Hearers; and we will abide the tryal of that when you pleaſe; for you ought to be Servants; and was it ever known in Chriſts time, that the Servants made a Law to govern ſuch whom they ſerved. But I tell thee, my Propoſition doth not tend to exerciſe any Rule over you, or your Faith and Conſciences, but to level you a little; and I think it is time, nay, more than time, that ſuch a Law or Order, or what you will call it, was made to check a few Uſurpers, who have neither the Law of God, the Law of the Land, nor the Cuſtome of any Church to Pattern your imperious Carriage, your monſtrous Cenſures of ſuch as will not fall down, and crouch under you; wherefore conſider of theſe things, and be humbled, that your Backſlidings may be healed. See, <hi>the Memory of</hi> John Story <hi>Revived,</hi> &amp;c. Oh that you had taken the Advice of ſuch as he was, then might it have been well with you; which I know he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired and laboured for.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>I do acknowledge it a low and baſe thing of</hi> F. B. <hi>to make ſuch a Law, and to proffer me</hi> 15 <hi>l. — I do know, the</hi> 15 <hi>l. that</hi> F. B. <hi>pretends ſo freely to give me, if I will ſign his new invented Order, he hath wrongfully by defraud got into his hand of my Money,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>F. B</hi>'s <hi>Anſw.</hi> I deny that it is either low or baſe; 1ſt. it is a valuable Summe, and a good conſideration for the matter in hand, and ſuits well with the Gift which the <hi>Commons</hi> gave to King <hi>Hen. III.</hi> for <hi>Magna Charta;</hi> which was the 15th. part of their <hi>Moveables.</hi> And ſince you of the Miniſtry of the Ruling Party, Reign as Kings over us, making a Law or Cannon, <hi>That in Suffering Times we muſt meet conſtantly, whatever is ſaid to the contrary, and neither Forſake, Decline, nor Remove our Meetings, if we will be owned as Members in the Church of Chriſt.</hi> See your Law at large as recited in my Expoſtulation, ſigned by <hi>G.W. S.C.</hi> &amp;c. of you of the Ruling Leaders, who have cauſed the People to err; at whoſe Doors we lay our Complaint for all our late Diviſions, Diſtractions, and the Conſequences of them. And I deny that I came by the 15 <hi>l.</hi> fraudulently, but it was paid me by thy Wives Meſſenger, <hi>G. S.</hi> of which I have fully treated.</p>
                  <p>Thus having anſwered <hi>S. C</hi>'s Reaſon-leſs Reaſons, I come now to take a little notice of <hi>G. W</hi>'s diſ-ingenious and baſe way of traducing me in Print; whoſe method is ſo abominable, as that the very <hi>Heathen</hi> would be aſhamed of the like Practice; and if I ſeem ſharper than ſome think it meet, let them blame <hi>G.W.</hi> and his Approvers and Abettors, for I find my ſelf concerned in point of my Reputation, both as a <hi>Man</hi> and <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> to put off the <hi>Bears-Skin</hi> which they would wrap me in, if I were ſo tame as to wear it; but I ever hated to be Prieſt-ridden, when amongſt them, and ſhall I now ſubmit to a few Uſurpers in their <hi>Extra Judicial</hi> Proceedings? For if ever man had cauſe to take up a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint againſt a ſort of Tyrannical Uſurpers, and Arbitrary Rulers, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Notion of <hi>Church-Governours.</hi> I am, ſurely, the man (as well as ſome others) I remember a Saying by King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt.</p>
                  <q>There is no Proceedings juſt againſt any man, but what is warranted either by Gods Laws, or the municipal Laws of the Countrey where he lives.</q>
                  <p>And now I will appeal to any Judicious man, whether it be according to the Law of God to condemn a man without a hearing? Nay, which
<pb n="58" facs="tcp:44050:37"/> is worſe, by <hi>G. W.</hi> who is a Stranger to what paſt betwixt <hi>G. S.</hi> and my ſelf; and is ſo confident, that he, upon <hi>G. S</hi>'s bare word, without any other evidence of the matter, prints, and expoſes me to be a fraudulent, over-reaching man: which I take to be ſcandalous, and do intend further to examine the ſame; and this is both againſt the Law of God, and the municipal Laws of my Countrey where I dwell; and ſuch dealing as theſe my bitter and malitious Adverſaries uſe againſt me, the <hi>Heathens</hi> would be aſhamed of; the <hi>Saints</hi> abhor them; the Practice of all the Reformed Churches condemns them for. The common Law of <hi>England</hi> relieves all that ſuffer Damages by Treſpaſſes committed or done, where there is good evidence; and where evidence is lacking, as oft times it is in divers Caſes, Proviſion is made in the <hi>Court of Chancery,</hi> that the Oppreſſed may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, and the Oppreſſors repelled: but theſe are Puniſhments too too ſlender for this envious man <hi>G. W.</hi> or elſe they feared, that I had ſo much right of my ſide, as that I could have pleaded to their Declaration, or replyed to their Bill: but that which renders their Proceedings yet more abominable, the matter betwixt <hi>S. C. G. S.</hi> and my ſelf, was ended and finally determined at our <hi>Quarterly-Meeting,</hi> the 1ſt. of <hi>December,</hi> 1680; that no more Controverſy ſhould be, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But as ſoon as I had put forth my Book, <hi>De Chr. Lib.</hi> they preſently ſet it abroach, and by their Practice ſeem to manifeſt, it is their Judgment, <hi>No Faith was to be kept with Hereticks.</hi> Well, as ſoon as I perceived that, I forthwith ſent <hi>S. C.</hi> a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, that if he was not ſatisfied with the ſaid Agreement, that I would grant him a Hearing again, by Perſons choſe to arbitrate the <hi>Matter</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>twixt us; that ſo he might make his wrong (if he apprehended the <hi>Quarterly Meeting</hi> wronged him) known, and be capacitated to relieve himſelf, which is the beſt and moſt proper Expedient we have amongſt us, to decide matters. All this took no place, for my Book had ſo diſturbed them, that they ſought all occaſion againſt me they could, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Object But by this time ſome may be ready to object and ſay, <hi>If they have revived that buſineſs about the</hi> Fine <hi>which was ended, and would not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept of an Arbitration the ſecond time, when proffered to them, nor yet proceed legally in any of the Kings Courts, but expoſe the Name and Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their Adverſaries in Print; then it looks like a meer piece of Malice and Revenge, as if they wanted other Matter wherewithal to anſwer thy Book. This is a Practice ſo hateful to all Judicious Perſons, that it will turn greatly to their Diſ-repute, Contempt, Shame, and Confuſion of face, and loar their Topſail greatly; ſince amongſt us</hi> Proteſtants <hi>'tis never known, that a Caſe is Printed and expoſed to publick view, upon every mans own bare words and thoughts, until Judiciouſly heard, and a</hi> Verdict <hi>paſs upon it; and then ſome eminent Caſes are printed for the help and information of young</hi> Students, &amp;c.</p>

                     <hi>Anſ.</hi> I find the ſtrength of this <hi>Objection</hi> is placed, or bottomed upon the occaſion that moved <hi>S. C.</hi> and <hi>G. W.</hi> to publiſh their Relation or Narrative about the <hi>Fine;</hi> and I do ſay, that it was my Book, for until I had printed my Book <hi>De Chr. Lib.</hi> I heard no noiſe of a Narrative, I was not called upon the Stage at <hi>London:</hi> but as ſoon as I perceived their In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, to revive the ſaid Controverſy, I ſent to <hi>S. C.</hi> the offer of a new Election. But that took no place, though I ſent it to <hi>G. W.</hi> alſo. But ſoon after I had a large Letter came from <hi>G. W.</hi> chiefly as Printed, wherein he ſaid as in his <hi>Judgment Fixed,</hi> p. 252. <q rend="margSglQuotes">And I deſire to know, if after the reading and peruſing of this my large Letter, thou art at all minded to relent and retract thy BOOK, or any part of it, and according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to give forth a plain CONDEMNATION, or RECANTATION as publick. To this I expect Anſwer ſhortly from thee, otherwiſe trouble me not with any diſ-ingenious or ſcurrilous Letters.</q> And after he had waited for my Recantation a while, and ſaw it not, then he ſoon went to printing as ſcurrilous and as defaming as he could; <hi>Judgment Fixed:</hi> But by his before recited words it is plain, that if I would have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned my Book, and made a publick Recantation, I might have had Room enough, and been received into <hi>Mother Church,</hi> and abſolved from the ſin of the 15 <hi>l.</hi> And no further Proceſs had been iſſued out from our <hi>Exchequer</hi> in Temporals, and Church Triumphant in Spirituals, namely the <hi>Second-days Meeting</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>All which may ſerve for great part of an Anſwer to the <hi>Objection.</hi> But by reaſon I may carry things very plain, I will recite a Letter, wherein the like Pardon was proffered, and my Anſwer to the ſame; by which it will yet more plainly appear to be a piece of Revenge, by reaſon I did ſo Annatomiſe their Image of <hi>Church Government</hi> in my former Book. But let me be never ſo plain and demonſtrative, I doubt not but they will evade theſe things what in them lye, and ſay either, they did not mean ſo; or, that I took but part of their Letters, and left out either the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going, or ſubſequent and explanatory words, altho ſometimes I print their whole Letters; which I do not find them ſo fair by me, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Or elſe I take an intire Paragraph or Sentence; which they ſeldom do without curtailing; and for proof, let the Reader compare page by page: and ſometimes they'l ſay, <hi>I lye, I lye,</hi> tho it be as really true as a man can write.

                  <p>But however, if I have not worded the manner of the Kings remitting Offences, againſt his known Laws, ſince my intent was not to diſhonour him: I had rather rely on his Clemency ſtill for a ſecond For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs, ſince I have had experience of the firſt, than at the mercy of <hi>G.

Again, it was not made by Boys, nor by the Men of the World, but by a full Synod of <hi>Clergy</hi> and <hi>Layity.</hi> Again, it was not barely concluded by verbal Diſcourſe, and ſo left; which the Men of the World reckon binding to, when all Parties agree; but RE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CORDED.

                     <p>It is my Judgment, that all Friends &amp; People that profeſs Chriſt Jeſus to be their Lord, &amp; deſire to worſhip God acceptably, they ought to wait upon him and as the Apoſtle ſaid, <hi>Not forſake the aſſembling themſelves together;</hi> as the manner of ſome then was: What was their manner?

And that I may the better confirm my Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion herein, I may incert part of the Apology of <hi>Athanaſius,</hi> that good man in his time; and the rather becouſe he confirmed his Perſwaſion with the Authority of Holy Scripture, which by an eminent hand of Divine Providence, hath been conveyed down to us, who though unworthy of ſo great a favour, becauſe ſo much ſlighted.</p>

What anſwer can theſe Bablers give, when they ſee that the great Prophet <hi>Elias,</hi> who ſo devoutly called upon the Name of God, and raiſed the dead, was fain to hide himſelf from <hi>Ahab,</hi> and run away becauſe of the threats of <hi>Jezabel:</hi> for it is is written, how that <hi>in thoſe days the Sons of the Prophets being ſought for, hid themſelves, and through the help of</hi> Oba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia <hi>lurked in Dens.</hi> Are they ignorant alſo of ſuch things as the <hi>Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts</hi> have written?

Moreover <hi>Paul</hi> being at <hi>Damaſcus,</hi> and ſought for by the Governour of that Countrey, was let down over the Wall in a Basket, and ſo eſcaped the Magiſtrate. Thus the holy Scripture hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred the Behaviour of holy men—furthermore the word of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther,
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:44050:41"/> who in old time ſpake unto <hi>Moſes,</hi> hath commanded in theſe latter days, <hi>When they ſhall perſecute you in this City, flee unto another</hi> — The which when holy Men had learned, they framed their Trade of Life agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able thereunto. For look whatſoever the Lord commanded at that time, the ſame he uttered by the Mouths of his Servants; yea, before his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carnation. And this is the way to Perfection, for men to perform that in Deed, which the Lord commanded in Word. Wherefore the Word of God being made Man for our ſakes, ſtick't not to hide himſelf, as we commonly do, when he was ſought for; and again, to flee, to the end he might avoid the Conſpiracy of the <hi>Phariſees,</hi> which petſecuted him; for even as by Patient Sufferance of Hunger, and Thirſt, and ſuch kind of Miſeries, he would ſhew himſelf to be true man; ſo alſo by fleeing from the face of the Adverſary: moreover even from the very Cradle, and Swadling Clouts, as ſoon as he had taken fleſh of the Virgin, being as yet but a Child, he gave charge unto <hi>Joſeph</hi> by the Angel, ſaying, <hi>Ariſe, take the Child, together with his Mother, and flee into</hi> Aegypt; <hi>for it will come to paſs, that</hi> Herod <hi>will go about to ſeek the Life of the Child.</hi> Likewiſe after- the deceaſe of <hi>Herod,</hi> that <hi>Archelaus</hi> the Son of <hi>Herod</hi> Reigned in his ſtead, it pleaſed him to go aſide into the Parts of <hi>Nazareth.</hi> Afterwards, when he made himſelf manifeſt to be God, and healed the Withered-hand, the <hi>Phariſees</hi> went out, and took counſel how they might diſpatch him; but Jeſus perceiving their Conſpiracy, conveyed himſelf from among them. Again, when he reſtored <hi>Lazarus</hi> to Life, <hi>from that day forth,</hi> ſaith the Text, <hi>they took council how they might put him to death. Jeſus therefore, after that time, ſhewed not himſelf openly among the</hi> Jews, <hi>but departed into a ſolitary Place adjoyning to the Wilderneſs.</hi> Beſides, when our Saviour avouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, ſaying, <hi>Before</hi> Abraham <hi>was, I am; the</hi> Jews <hi>took up Stones for to throw at him, but he hid himſelf,</hi> &amp;c.</q>

To this purpoſe was that of Jeſus, who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding of the beheading of <hi>John</hi> the <hi>Baptiſt,</hi> and burying of his Body by his Diſciples, took Shipping, and went aſide into a Deſert Place.

<pb n="67" facs="tcp:44050:41"/> it may eaſily be proved, that they are altogether ignorant of what the <hi>Evangeliſts</hi> have left us in writing. The cauſe that moved our Saviour to fly, and go aſide, being laid down in the Goſpel, ſeemed, not only to be agreeable unto Reaſon, but was in very deed moſt true: we therefore have to conjecture, that the ſame by all liklihood happened unto all the Saints of God; for whatſoever things are written to have chanced unto our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our after the manner of men, we have to referr the ſame unto all Mankind, inſomuch as he took our Nature upon him, and lively expreſſed in him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the humane Affections of our frail Conſtitutions, even as it is written in <hi>John</hi>'s Goſpel, <hi>They ſought to take him, but no man laid hands upon him, becauſe his hour was not yet come.</hi> Yea, before this came about, he ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his Mother, <hi>My hour is not yet come.</hi> He ſpake alſo unto them that were called his Brethren, <hi>My time is not come.</hi> Again, when the hour was come, he ſaid unto his Diſciples, <hi>Sleep on now, and take your Reſt, behold the hour is at hand, the Son of Man ſhall be betrayed into the hands of Sinners.</hi> There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore neither ſuffered he himſelf to be taken before his time was come, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hid himſelf when the hour was at hand, but yielded himſelf unto the Enemies. In like ſort, the bleſſed <hi>Martyrs,</hi> in the great heat and trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome Storms of Perſecution, which often came to paſs, being purſued by men, fled away and hid themſelves in ſecret and ſolitary Places; but be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taken, they valliantly encountred with their Adverſaries, and ended the Combat with Martyrdom.</q> Theſe were the Reaſons <hi>Athanaſius</hi> laid down in his <hi>Apology;</hi> the which he wrote in the defence of his Depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from his Biſhoprick in time of Perſecution.</p>

                     <p>Thus do we ſee the manner of the Sufferings, and the manner of the Saints Meetings, was various; and therefore the holy Apoſtle did not ſay, <hi>you muſt neither Forſake, Decline,</hi> nor <hi>Remove your Meetings;</hi> but his Exhortation was, not to forſake the Aſſembling themſelves together, as the manner of ſome was: and ſo as to the manner, he left it to them who were to be exerciſed therein, who were to wait upon God, and to Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip him as he ſhould order them by his Holy Spirit, and the Guidance thereof, and according to the meaſure of Faith they had received of him, to bear up their heads in Suffering Times; and if ſome met privately for fear of the <hi>Jews,</hi> and other met in an upper Chamber, yet the Apoſtle was far from calling them <hi>Night-dippers, Skulkers,</hi> and <hi>Creepers, Cowardly, Baſs and Timerous, Carna Policy, Occult creeping, creeping into Garrets, Cheeſe-Lofts, Coal-hoals,</hi> and ſuch like <hi>Mice-walks, By-holes,</hi> &amp;c. as <hi>G.

                     <p>By this time ſome may be ready to object, and ſay, <hi>That altho it cannot be denyed, but your Miniſters of the Self-ſaving, and others-oppreſſing Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, have given juſt occaſion for a publick Reproof, not only by their making a Law for their Hearers, that they ſhould meet, and not decline the ſame, contrary to the very nature, Tendency and Example of that Chriſtian Liberty which was taught by Chriſt, and practiſed by his holy Apoſtles, and Primitive Chriſtians, as is evident by Scripture, and by</hi> Athanaſius <hi>his Apology; and that themſelves walk and Practice contradictory thereunto, but alſo by their publick Defamati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and ſcurrilous Invectives, whereby they expoſe not only</hi> W. R. F. B. T. C. J. S. <hi>and thoſe of their own Society to be</hi> Judaſes, Beaſts, Dogs, Wolves, Children of the Devil, <hi>yea,</hi> Devils Incarnate, <hi>&amp;c. but alſo every other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of People, with whom they happen to controvert (as if all others beſides themſelves, were of old predeſtinated to Eternal Deſtruction, and themſelves the only Electives,</hi> &amp;c.) <hi>yet however, for the ſake of ſome amongſt them, a more private way ought to have been firſt uſed,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> In anſwer to this <hi>Objection</hi> I do ſay, that I have wrote to them about theſe things for theſe ſeven or eight years, and ſent great part of what is here printed, in Manuſcript, one Paper which I called, <hi>A Cry for Juſtice;</hi> another called, <hi>A Preſcript and Poſtſcript;</hi> another, <hi>Speeches and Paſſages,</hi> with divers other Letters, endeavouring to let them ſee their Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rour, if poſſible, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And now at laſt I wrote to the <hi>Second-days Meeting,</hi> the 10th. of the 2d. Mo. 83 ſignifying, that if ſix of them <hi>(i. e.)</hi> of the <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond-days Meeters,</hi> would ſhew their publick diſlike and non-approve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of <hi>G. W</hi>'s Book, called, <hi>Judgment Fixed,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>R. S</hi>'s, called, <hi>Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous Judgment,</hi> &amp;c. and the <hi>Advertiſement</hi> prefixt thereon, and ſigned by their Clark <hi>R. R.</hi> that then I would forbear any Reply to the ſaid Books, notwithſtanding they had defamed me in a groſs manner; and all this for the ſake of the honeſt-minded among them: but no condiſcention they can admit of; nor, no Anſwer have I received, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And if the ſaid well-meaning People will ſit down, and conſent to the perfidious Dealings of that Meeting, and be more tame than the Nobles and Barons in the Reign of
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:44050:42"/> King <hi>Hen. II. Ed. II. Hen. III. &amp;c.</hi> who often called the proud Prelates to account, and ſhewed what Enemies the Prelates were to the Peace of the Kingdom; I cannot help it. Nay, the Women in <hi>London</hi> knocked at the Parliaments Doors, in <hi>Olivers</hi> Time, and called for Juſtice. Juſtice, on the behalf of <hi>J. Lilburn</hi> and others. And if the People called <hi>Quakers</hi> will allow a few Uſurpers, <hi>Viz. G.W. St. C. G. Fox Ch. T. R. R.</hi> and a few others, who neither conſult Events, nor fear Effects, to ſit Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roniſing over the Conſciences of their Brethren, and never call them to an account, and knock at their door, and ſay, What mean you to ſit here? What buſineſs have you here? Why do ye give occaſion for theſe Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies? Though you fear no Effects that may hereupon enſue, yet we have cauſe; though you ſtudy no Events, yet we that are as much concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as you, do think that it ſtands us in hand to ſtudy the Events of theſe things. Why do you approve of the Printing and Publiſhing of Books ſcandalous to Truth, and the Profeſſors of it; and why do you deal thus treacherous with the People? Why do you thus exalt your ſelves, and make your Neſt among the Stars, and ſit as a <hi>Queen,</hi> ſaying, <hi>I am, and there is none beſides me.</hi>

And the Record of Condemnation againſt <hi>J.

See <hi>De Chr. Lib.</hi> p. 17. 171. 172. Upon which I promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to forbear any further Teſtimony, whether by Print or otherwiſe, in hopes that things might be yet amended. This I then propoſed as a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per expedient to prevent what I then thought might enſue. And after I had ſo wrought, and could receive no Anſwer, I took the pains to come up to <hi>London</hi> (and came in Perſon to you of the <hi>Second-days Meeting,</hi> where were aſſembled <hi>G. F. G. W. C. T.</hi> and divers of the Miniſters and Leaders of <hi>G. F</hi>'s Party) with a Letter from divers of my Neighbouring Friends, (as printed in, <hi>De Chr.

<pb n="71" facs="tcp:44050:43"/> anſwer my Letter, ſo you refuſed to anſwer that; yea, and diſcourſe me a word about that my buſineſs, but bid me be gone (by your Brother, that infamous <hi>C. Tayler.</hi>) And I muſt now tel you, that had you been cloathed with the Prieſts Veſtiments, I ſhould have thought you to have been an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act Parrellel to a Company of Proud, Laſy, Lordly Prelates; for your Carriage to me rather reſembles them than humble Miniſters of Chriſt; whoſe buſineſs ever was to ſeek the Loſt; which, you never endeavoured, if ſuch an one you account me; but bid me, be gone, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                           </p>
                           <p>And now I write to you again, for the ſake of the well-meaning People amongſt you; That if ſix of you, under your hands, and ſigned alſo by your Clark as Evidence to the ſame, will within 12 days ſhew your publick diſlike and non-approbation of <hi>G. W</hi>'s Book, called, <hi>Judgment Fixed;</hi> and <hi>R. S</hi>'s piece, called, <hi>Righteous Judgment;</hi> and the <hi>Advertiſement</hi> prefixt thereon; that then I ſhall forbear a Reply to them, and for the Peoples ſake, promiſe not to anſwer them, until further occaſion be adminiſtred, and ſhall look upon them as produced by <hi>G. W.</hi> and <hi>R. S.</hi> ſingly of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and on their own heads as wicked Inſtruments, who neither conſult Events, nor fear Effects; for ſo <hi>G. W.</hi> ſays in plain words, in his Epiſtle to his <hi>Judgment Fixed,</hi> &amp;c. and <hi>S. C.</hi> to the ſame effect in a Letter to me. Neither indeed is there much cauſe for them to ſtudy Events, or fear Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects, upon their own Principles of not telling their Name and Habitati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, unleſs demanded by a Magiſtrate. But if you ſlight this my Chriſtian Propoſition, then I do hereby let you know, that altho I do not intend to give a full Anſwer to their ridiculous Folly and impertinent Stories, until I ſee <hi>S.
